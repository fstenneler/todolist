- "One conversation dominated the interval chit-chat at my most recent visit to the Globe Theatre. We must give back the USA to the native Americans right away! I suppose that's why I don't let society define my gender!"
- "Whilst looking for a charging spot for my electric car it came to me. I would rather vote for the BNP than let my three year old eat anything sold in Asda! But that's just what we get when we continue to measure economic growth through GDP rather than focusing on freedom of expression and sustainability."
- "Chatting to the builder sprucing up our conservatory, I started to ponder. One cannot re-read Kafka enough these days - the lessons for our generation especially have never been more salient. But I guess that's just what happens when we let Saudi oil magnates rape our ecosystems and ruin the planet."
- "We were chatting over a coffee, simple filter, not Nescafe (baby-killers) and started to think out loud. Before economic development, the people of Africa need to regain confidence in their cultural identity. The left needs to unite and stop letting the neo-fascists talk down to us."
- "I wonder what Emmeline Pankhurst would have thought of today's culture? Judging children's abilities by standardised exams denies them their unique individuality and the expression of their culturally distinct identities. I suppose that's why I don't let society define my gender!"
- "Collecting my oak-smoked Salmon and dry-cured Trout direct from the smokehouse led me to a fascinating chat with the proprietor this afternoon. The salt-of-the-earth type jobs some of my primary school classmates ended up in just don't exist any more. And that's why prison is the best place to show the vulnerable that we care."
- "Why does sexuality still define us? How can we expect the next generation to get their five-a-day when even Waitrose don't sell traditional British apple varieties? We should all go back to living in communes like they did in Sweden in the 70s!"
- "I don't go to the pub often since I hate commercial lagers, but I was drinking an American Pale Ale with a friend yesterday and it really got us thinking. How can we expect the next generation to get their five-a-day when even Waitrose don't sell traditional British apple varieties? It's a shame no-one was listening when I warned about the dangers of GMOs."
- "Chatting to the builder sprucing up our conservatory, I started to ponder. I would rather vote for the BNP than let my three year old eat anything sold in Asda! But that's the fallout from having PM Bliar for a decade!"
- "It's typical of the British media that this is the first I've heard of this dreadful situation. I take a desert spoon full of Organic Blackstrap Molasses with hot water each day after exercice. The problem is that we're always competing instead of working together."
- "Collecting my oak-smoked Salmon and dry-cured Trout direct from the smokehouse led me to a fascinating chat with the proprietor this afternoon. How can we expect the next generation to get their five-a-day when even Waitrose don't sell traditional British apple varieties? Unless we send out a clear message to the Bob Diamonds and Howard Schultz's of this world they will never learn!"
- "Last Saturday, as I was weeding my organic foxglove bed, it struck me! It's absurd we haven't yet reached full equality for all ethno-sexual persuasions. It's time for the working class to fight back!"
- "Chatting to the builder sprucing up our conservatory, I started to ponder. I would rather vote for the BNP than let my three year old eat anything sold in Asda! I guess Marx was more right than he knew when he warned us against the dangers of laissez-faire capitalism."
- "My holiday home in Provence is hardly a luxury! Of course Church is important but our little Sophia managed to fit in Diwali, Ramadan, Kwanza and, of course, Chanukah, just in her small group of friends. The problem is that we're always competing instead of working together."
- "Collecting my oak-smoked Salmon and dry-cured Trout direct from the smokehouse led me to a fascinating chat with the proprietor this afternoon. If we all paid more regular visits to our local Turkish tea shops we might better understand why Armenia is such a complicated issue. Free Gaza now!"
- "It occured to me recently after an entire afternoon at the Southwell vintner, had we tasted anything that could match the Malbecs we had on our most recent trip to Chile? Are we opressing Bradley Manning more by imprisoning him, or by forcing him to live as a man? We should have never let Clegg into government!"
- "A touch of nutmeg really bolsters the egg flavours in an otherwise traditional Yorkshire pudding, which can really focus the mind on other issues. Soil depletion is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the challenges faced by African peasant farmers today. Viva la revolucion! Viva Chavez."
- "I was talking to friends at the local fair-trade delicatessen and we're agreed. How can we expect the next generation to get their five-a-day when even Waitrose don't sell traditional British apple varieties? But how can we expect things to improve whilst China are still in Tibet!"
- "Over last night's simple dinner of Moules Marinieres my life-partner and I caught up on some thoughts we've been sharing recently. Soil depletion is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the challenges faced by African peasant farmers today. But that's the fallout from having PM Bliar for a decade!"
- "I was talking to friends at the local fair-trade delicatessen and we're agreed. It's absurd we haven't yet reached full equality for all ethno-sexual persuasions. That just goes to show what happens when global corporations can get their hands on our personal information!"
