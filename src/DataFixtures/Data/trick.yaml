    name : Melon grab
    description : "Front hand grabs the heel edge between the bindings.\nThe textbook melon has the front leg boned, poking the nose straight out as far as possible. Typically performed with a flat poke, here Castro pokes this melon a bit backside, with a mellow little tail kick out. Giving these grabs your own twist is one of the beautiful freedoms of snowboarding.\nThe melon grab name is actually a shorthand spelling evolution of the original grab name melanchollie, which is a clever piece of wordplay. Originally performed mid-ollie, skateboarders would poke this grab in a very similar fashion to a sad plant, yet with the front hand on the backside rail. With the word melancholy being a synonym for sad, and essentially containing the word ollie, the melanchollie title was born.\nWho was the wordsmith behind this bit of genius? This is where history scratches its head. TWSKATE alumni Garry Davis and Miki Vuckovich checked with skate pioneers Tony Hawk and Jeff Grosso, and nobody could confirm where the term originated. The top ideas were that it was possibly coined by Neil Blender (a certifiable creative genius) or that it was perhaps a Hawk/Lester Kasai collaboration. What we do know is that the first published shot in TransWorld SKATEboarding of a melon, ran in the February 1989 issue with the following caption: “Using home turf to its fullest, Natas Kaupas peaks a Melanchollie (or ollie to sad air) over the hip at Venice High.”"

    name : Bloody Dracula
    description : "Front hand reaches around the back all the way to the tail, while the rear hand also grabs tail.\nFront leg boned, rear leg bent, the nose is aggressively poked down, doing whatever it takes to get ahold of this grab.\nThe bloody Dracula’s name origin is as mysterious as Count Dracula himself. The first usage of the term Dracula in grab naming was by North Carolina to Northwest snowboard transplant J.D. Platt, who invented and coined the term lien Dracula in 1989 during The Timberline Classic halfpipe competition at Timberline, Oregon (Mt. Hood). J.D. aired on his frontside wall, grabbing heel edge with his rear hand (across the front of the body like a nuclear method), while simultaneously grabbing toe edge with his front hand between the front foot and the nose. Since this grab somewhat resembled a lien air with his arms crossed in front of him (vampire sleeping style) he called it a lien Dracula. With the term Dracula introduced into snowboarding, it was later repurposed for the reach around double tail grabbing trick performed above.\nOriginally, a true bloody Dracula required the arms to be crossed behind the back (explaining the use of the Dracula reference). After this grab was included on Travis Parker’s Capita “Unorthodox” pro model with its built-in graphic grabbing guide (without explaining that the arms needed to be crossed), the crossed arm requirement relaxed over the coming decade, and uncrossed versions are also now given the Dracula distinction (a confusing departure from why the term Dracula was used in the first place)."

    description : "Front hand reaches around the base from the back and grabs the toe edge between the feet.\nPull that board straight up like you’re holding a suitcase and arch your back.\nDuring the early days there were pro riders (who shall respectfully remain nameless) who grabbed this way thinking they were doing methods. Clowning this style, other riders started calling these suitcase (and briefcase) methods. This grab is always good for a laugh, so pack your bags, and check into a big backside AirBnB next time youre at the mountain."

    name : Rodeo
    description : "The basic frontside rodeo is all together a 540. It essentially falls into a grey area between an off axis frontside 540 and a frontside 180 with a back flip blended into it. The grab choice and different line and pop factors can make it more flipy or more of an off-axis spin. Frontside rodeo can be done off the heels or toes and with a little more spin on the Z Axis can go to 720 or 900. It is possible to do it to a 1080 but, if there is too much flip in the spin, it can be hard not to over flip when going past 720 and 900. The bigger the Z Axis spin, the later the inverted part of the rotation should be. Gaining control on big spin rodeos, may lead to a double cork or a second flip rotation in the spin, if the rider has developed a comfort level with double flips on the tramp or other gymnastic environment.;Rodeo flip; frontside rodeo: A frontward-flipping frontside spin done off the toe-edge. Most commonly performed with a 540° rotation, but also performed as a 720°, 900°, etc.. Approach: Come in switch on your heel edge, roll over to your toe edge as you approach the lip.\nTakeoff: Put your weight on your back foot, wait til you get to the top of the lip, and pop off your tail. Dont put too much weight on your toes or youll catch as you takeoff.\nManeuver: Start your rotation slowly. Pull your front shoulder back, and look up while bringing your knees to you for a mute grab. Once you look up, youve done everything. Just wait for the landing to come around.\nLanding: Halfway through you can spot your landing. Wait for your board to come around and land on your toes.\nIts all in the way you twist your shoulders. Its only a 540, so turn nice and slow on the takeoff."

    description : "Frontside Cork 540's have to be one of the best feeling tricks in snowboarding. This combination of flip and spin is easy on the eyes, and surprisingly easy in general after you get the feeling for it.\nCheck out the Snowboard Tutorial Membership for more great tips.\n(Narrating/Riding: Chase Baines Film/Edit: Adison MacDonald. Filmed At: Whistler Blackcomb & Whistler Bounce)\nGet Confident. Get Committed.\nBefore attempting Frontside Cork 540's, make sure you have good flat Frontside 5's and have some experience with inverts like Backflips and Wildcats.\nGetting comfortable with Backflips will make commitment much easier\nThe Proper Set Up\nThere are 4 points to keep in mind when setting up:\nRoll in with a classic Frontside set up carve.\nLean back as you reach the lip and pop from your heel edge and tail.\nKick your back leg in the direction of your lead shoulder.\nDrop your lead shoulder into a back flipping motion as you initiate your Frontside spin.\nPop, Kick, Drop and Turn\nFlip Don't Trip!\nWhen you start to flip, commit to it and follow all the way through. Trying to bail out of an invert halfway can be dangerous.\nWhat Grab?!\nIndy grab is a crowd favourite for learning Frontside Corks, but in the end it's all up to you. You may want to try it with an indy grab, or stick to the grab your most comfortable spinning Frontside with.\nKeep your other arm out to help control your flip.\nSpins To Do. Landings to See.\nSpotting the landing is pretty easy on this one. Simply turn your head in the direction of the spin and look past your lead arm and shoulder. If your head and upper body are initiating into the correct axis, you should be able to see your landing almost as soon as you leave the lip.\nThe landing is pretty much visible all the way around\nThe Frontside Cork can be a little intimidating at first. If you have the foundations down, it will get easier and easier as you become more comfortable spotting your landing. Now get out there and pop your cork!"

    name : Misty
    description : "The Misty Flip is a forward-spinning flip performed in freestyle sports such as freeskiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, inline skating[1] or trampolining. In its simplest form, it is a combination of a frontflip and a 180° rotation, called Misty Flip 540 (or Misty 5). The Misty Flip was first done by Jason King out of the Sugarbush half pipe circa 1991. The trick was later named by professional snowboarder Ali Goulet, an original member of the Vermont Snowboard Posse that included Jeff Brushie, Chris Swierz, and Josh Brownley. Unlike in acrobatic disciplines where athletes remain in the same plane in space during the trick, the front flip and the 180° spin are combined, creating a single continuous movement. Therefore, the frontflip counts as a 360° rotation, which added to the initial 180° spin, results in a 540° Misty Flip. Misty Flips can be performed in many variations with bigger spins, grabs and even double flips.\nIn order to perform a Misty Flip, a person must throw his shoulder down to his left or right side, commencing a spin while his head and body invert to an up-side down position. The person lands backwards or frontwards, depending on the rotation amount.\nIn snowboarding, when performed on a straight jump, the motion initiates a rotation that mimics that of a McTwist, which is generally performed in halfpipes and on quarterpipes. However, because the Misty Flip is performed on a straight jump, it is further distinguished from a McTwist because the snowboarder lands backwards following the 540 rotation.\nThe Misty Flip was first popularized by Peter Line in the video Transworld Snowboarding Video Magazine Volume 1."

    name : Miller flip
    description : "In skateboarding, a Miller Flip is a Frontside Handplant where you flip all the way around to Fakie. In snowboarding however, this trick has evolved and is now commonly known as an inverted Frontside 360, while dragging your front hand over a feature.\nTo get access to even more inverted snowboard tutorials, check out our Snowboard Tutorial Membership.\n(Narrating/Riding: Nev Lapwood)\nRequired Skills\nBefore you take on the Miller Flip, you MUST be very comfortable with Front 3's on all kinds of features. If you are able to Handplant, that is a bonus also.\nStep 1) Motion\nGet freaky and learn the motion of the Miller Flip on your bed. Stand at the end of the bed in your snowboard stance. Jump and roll your back over the side of the bed, landing back in your snowboard stance.\nBed FlipDon't be fooled by the innocent wall colour, this bedroom is a place of savagery, snowboard savagery.\nThis technique isn't designed to spice up your bedroom life, it's designed to simulate the motion of an off axis 360. Use a Training Board for even better practice, as this will allow you to incorporate the Indy Grab.\nStep 2) Feature\nFinding a feature that lends itself to Miller Flips is gonna make learning this trick a hell of a lot easier. The ideal feature has an upwards lip, a feature in the middle, a downhill landing and looks like this...\nThe Perfect FeatureTrick Tip: The steeper the angles, the easier it will be to learn.\nStep 3) Warm Up\nGet familiar with the speed required by doing a few straight airs. Following this, do a few Front 3's over the feature to become even more confident on the feature.\nFrontside 360Do bunch of Front 3's over the feature. Like this many.\nAfter this, try tapping your tail on the feature, or throwing in an Indy Grab to start tweaking it out.\nMiller Flip TapTapping the feature is a good progression step.\nThese are the perfect warm up techniques as they use the exact same speed, entry path and landing as the Frontside Miller Flip.\nStep 4) Mellow Attempts\nApproach the feature with the same speed and angle as if you're about to do a Frontside 360. Instead of popping from the heel edge, take off more from the tail of your board. This will initiate your weight slightly backwards and put you into the motion of an off axis Front 3.\nOn your first few attempts, you may find it easier to touch with both hands on the feature. This may mean you don't get off axis enough, but the trick will still work and with several attempts, you will start to get the feeling.\nDragging Both HandsWhen you start attempting this trick, dragging both hands is a good way to get comfortable with the corked feeling.\nSome common problems include trying to drag your front hand too soon or not taking enough speed through the feature. Make sure you pop from the lip before dragging your hand so that your motion is heading over the feature.\nStep 5) Off Axis\nA Miller Flip still looks good when only 90 degrees off axis. However, as you get further upside down it'll look more impressive and feel rad, just get a little more inverted with each try.\nTrick Tip: The further you lean back and the harder you pop from your tail, the more off axis you will get.\nAlthough the hand drag adds a tonne of style to the trick, it is also what stops you from going completely upside down and allows your motion to come back to your feet. Don't over exaggerate the pressure on your arm, it only has to be a light tickle.\nStep 6) Add Grab\nThe main way to make this trick look rad, is by grabbing. Your front hand is occupied with a bit of drag action, so the obvious thing to do is grab with your back hand. An Indy grab works great.\nHand Drag Miller FlipGrabbing Indy and dragging your front hand over the feature really makes the trick stand out.\nYou are able to do a Miller Flip without a grab, and it is easier to learn the trick without grabbing, but it looks so much better while grabbing. Remember to stay super compact in the air, bringing those knees to your chest to lock in the grab.\nBackside\nA Miller Flip is only the name of this trick when it is done in the Frontside direction. However, it is possible to learn a similar motion using a Backside spin. You can learn this trick, using the exact same steps as above:\nFind an appropriate feature\nWarm up with straight airs, grabs and Back 3's\nStart adding in more pop from the tail of the board, rather than your toe edge\nMellow attempt, not getting completely upside down, but aiming for the 90 degree mark\nBackside Miller FlipThe Backside Miller Flip. Pretty sweet huh'!\nYou can now Miller Flip! Remember, appropriate features are key to the Miller Flip. Always be on the hunt for the perfect setup because they not only assist your learning, but can also make this trick stand out. Take these tips and become part of the Miller family today!"

    description : "Do a backside invert and grab on the backside edge behind your back and between your feet.\nThis trick is named after 1970s skateboarder Dave Andrecht.\nThis can also be done with the front leg boned (sad). It then is called a Sad Andrecht (or Bonedrecht). An Andrecht where you grab the heel edge with your front hand between the legs is a Stelmasky.\nFor the basic Frontside invert, approach the frontside wall fairly straight-on while staying low and compressed. Hit the lip still compressed and push the board over your head as you roll back onto your front hand. Grab between your feet on the toe-side rail. Finally push off the wall with your arm and pull yourself in again to get the board back onto the snow. This is a very difficult trick to do well."

    description : "The Frontside Boardslide is a super steezy looking jib trick and today, we are teaching you how to get yours feeling goooood! Make sure you stay tuned to the Snowboard Addiction Blog, as we will be releasing more boardslide tutorials as a part of our 3 part Frontside Boardslide series:\nHow To Frontside Boardslide To Fakie\nHow To Improve Your Frontside Boardslides\nIf you don't want to wait, check out our Snowboard Tutorial Membership where they are available now!\n(Narrating/Riding: Nev Lapwood. Film/Edit: Adison MacDonald. Filmed At: Whistler Blackcomb)\nCounter Rotation\nThis is where your upper body and lower body will twist against each other throughout the trick.\nFrontside BoardslideA classic example of using counter rotation to complete the Frontside Boardslide.\nA counter rotated position is a very awkward feeling when you're first learning it. The best way to learn the movements for a front board, is to do it while sliding down a run. The counter rotation allows you to slide backwards, but look forwards while sliding.\nSliding Frontside BoardslideSliding the Frontside Boardslide is a great way to understand the movements required.\nThe Box\nWhen it comes to a box, start out using the 50-50 shuffle technique. This is where you will 50-50 the first half of the feature, and shuffle into the Front Board for the second half.\nFrontside Boardslide Shuffle50-50 then shuffle into a Frontside Boardslide position.\nDuring your first few attempts, you may only be able to shuffle 45 degrees or so, this is all gravy. As you get better, you'll be able to shuffle the full 90 degree position so you are sliding perpendicular with the box.\nUnstrap\nIf you are struggling with getting the correct movement, unstrap from your board to break it down. A technique to make the Front Board movement easier, is to have your upper body and arms twisted towards your tail as you're 50-50ing. This position makes it easier to shuffle into the Front Board position.\nUnstrappedUnstrapped from your board allows you to break down the Frontside Boardslide movements.\nTraining Board\nDid you know that you can even practice this at home? All you need is the Jib Training Board and Balance Bar!\nSnowboard Addiction Training EquipmentUse the gear and get an idea!\nJump into a 50-50 then initiate your arms and upper body towards the tail of your board while looking forward. Now, shuffle into that Front Board position and feel that counter rotated twisting through your core.\nJibbing\nWhen actually snowboarding, the shuffle technique is only a learning technique. It is not an actual trick, so please don't use it as your season ender. The aim of the shuffle technique is to give you the stepping stone until you are able to jump straight into the Front Board position.\nFrontside Boardslide\nTrick Tip: Speed is your friend! The faster you go, the smoother your board is going to slide across the feature. Once you're confident, slow it down a little for added style.\nAt The End\nAt the end of the feature, because you are in this counter rotated position, it's very easy to unwind and ride away in your normal snowboard stance.\nFrontside BoardslideThis is how you should approach the end of the rail.\nWe told you this is a stylish trick! Now you can add it to your bag of tricks. Use these tips to improve your riding today and get the Frontside Boardslide locked in!"

    description : "A slide performed where the rider's trailing foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle.[1] When performing a frontside lipslide, the snowboarder is facing downhill. When performing a backside lipslide, a snowboarder is facing uphill.\nAs you may already know, a Lipslide can only be done on a street style feature because you have to Ollie up and over the rail, bringing your back leg over the feature into the sliding position. In this tutorial, we will teach you how to Lipslide from the Frontside position.\nMake sure you check out the other tutorials in our Lipslide series.\nFor Frontside Lipslides, make sure you have these tricks on lock:\nBackside Boardslide\nFrontside 50-50\nWhere To Start?\nStart with a few Frontside 50-50s to get the feeling of the approach. Once that's comfortable, shuffle into the Frontside Lipslide position as you are sliding along the rail.\nThe Front Lip ShuffleThis shuffle technique is just for learning, it's not an actual trick. Don't include it in your season edit. Please.\nProgression\nIt's much more stylish if you can Ollie straight into the Front Lip position. The trick to doing this is approaching like a Frontside 50-50, but once you are high enough over the rail, Frontside Shifty into the Front Lip position and slide away.\nHopping Into Front LipYou may find on your first few attempts that you slide off the other side. \"Catching\" the rail with the correct board angle. This will stop you sliding off.\nFakie Or Regular?\nWhether you want to come out Fakie or in your normal stance all depends on whether you use rotation or counter rotation through the trick. Use rotation to come out Fakie, or use counter rotation to ride out in your normal stance.\nCounter Rotated Front LipWhat technique is used for this Front Lip? If you guessed counter rotation you weren't not correct.\nThat's all there is to it for the Frontside Lipslide! Simple when it's broken down huh!? If you've got Frontside 50-50s and Back Boards on lock, give this trick a go next time you're on the hill or in the streets and that will be another trick you have mastered. Happy shredding!"
